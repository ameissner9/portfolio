# Ava Meissner

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a data analyst passionate about using data to solve real-world problems. My projects combine rigorous statistical analysis with actionable insights—ranging from sports analytics to user behavior and music data modeling.

This page highlights selected work where I apply data science techniques to uncover meaningful patterns, build predictive models, and communicate results effectively.

## Featured Projects


### Online Learning User Experience (Private Data)  
**Tools:** R, dplyr, lme4, tidyr, ANOVA, mixed-effects models  
Analyzed engagement and performance data from multiple colleges to understand how students interact with digital course materials.

- Built mixed-effects and linear models to assess impact of time on page, task repetition, and motivational constructs  
- Applied ANOVA and Tukey HSD to identify trends across institutions and chapters  
- Delivered data-driven recommendations to improve chapter review questions and platform usability  
*Note: Project not published due to data sharing restrictions.*

### NFL Performance & Weather Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, SQL, PostgreSQL, psycopg2  
Built a full ETL pipeline and relational database to analyze NFL game data (2019–2022). Explored quarterback performance, defensive scoring brackets, and kicking accuracy across weather conditions.

- Designed and normalized PostgreSQL schema (game, weather, QB, defense, kicking)  
- Created reusable Python functions for querying and database operations  
- Conducted SQL-based analyses (e.g., Mahomes' average yards, defense trends by point range)

### Quarterback Contract Value Adjustment  
**Tools:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, clustering (hierarchical & k-means), regression modeling, RMarkdown  
Analyzed NFL quarterback performance and salary data to quantify contract efficiency. Developed a custom Contract Adjusted Value (CAV) metric to evaluate how well teams are leveraging their QB salary cap.

- Integrated salary and performance data; filtered for statistical relevance  
- Engineered CAV metric to compare production vs. salary impact  
- Applied hierarchical and k-means clustering to group QBs by value tier  
- Found that historically, lower-salary QBs provide higher ROI in Super Bowl appearances  
- Visualized trends using interactive and static charts; delivered results in RMarkdown

### Spotify Hit Song Analysis  
**Tools:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, glmnet, randomForest, decision trees, LASSO, ridge, RMarkdown  
Explored what drives a song’s popularity on Spotify using a dataset of top-charting tracks. Used statistical modeling and ML to predict streaming success and uncover key features.

- Built regression and tree-based models to predict stream counts  
- Identified danceability, speechiness, and release timing as key factors  
- Presented results in a reproducible RMarkdown report
