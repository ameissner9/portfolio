# Ava Meissner

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a data analyst with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. My projects combine rigorous statistical analysis with clear, actionable insights—ranging from sports analytics to music data modeling.

This page showcases selected work where I apply data science techniques to uncover meaningful patterns, build predictive models, and communicate results effectively.

## Featured Projects

### Spotify Hit Song Analysis
**Tools:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, glmnet, randomForest, RMarkdown  
Explored what drives a song’s popularity on Spotify using a dataset of top-charting tracks. Conducted statistical modeling and machine learning to predict streaming success and uncover key audio and chart features associated with high stream counts.

- Built regression and tree-based models to predict stream counts  
- Identified danceability, speechiness, and release timing as key factors  
- Cleaned, visualized, and presented results in a reproducible RMarkdown report

### Quarterback Contract Value Adjustment
**Tools:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, RMarkdown  
Analyzed NFL quarterback performance and salary data to develop an adjusted contract value metric. The project focused on quantifying the value teams receive relative to cap cost, using efficiency metrics and player statistics.

- Created a custom metric to evaluate contract value vs. on-field output  
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization  
- Presented findings with clear, interactive charts and contextual insights
