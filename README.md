## Featured Projects

### üèà NFL Performance & Weather Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, SQL, PostgreSQL, psycopg2  
Built a full ETL pipeline and relational database to analyze NFL game data (2019‚Äì2022). Explored quarterback performance, defensive scoring brackets, and kicking accuracy across weather conditions.

- Designed and normalized PostgreSQL schema (game, weather, QB, defense, kicking)  
- Created reusable Python functions for querying and database operations  
- Conducted SQL-based analyses (e.g., Mahomes' average yards, defense trends by point range)

### üéµ Spotify Hit Song Analysis  
**Tools:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, glmnet, randomForest, decision trees, LASSO, ridge, RMarkdown  
Explored what drives a song‚Äôs popularity on Spotify using a dataset of top-charting tracks. Used statistical modeling and ML to predict streaming success and uncover key features.

- Built regression and tree-based models to predict stream counts  
- Identified danceability, speechiness, and release timing as key factors  
- Presented results in a reproducible RMarkdown report

### üß™ Online Learning User Experience (Private Data)  
**Tools:** R, dplyr, lme4, tidyr, ANOVA, mixed-effects models  
Analyzed engagement and performance data from multiple colleges to understand how students interact with digital course materials.

- Built mixed-effects and linear models to assess impact of time on page, task repetition, and motivational constructs  
- Applied ANOVA and Tukey HSD to identify trends across institutions and chapters  
- Delivered data-driven recommendations to improve chapter review questions and platform usability
